I was watching a video the other day by the creator Tsoding about [Quines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGm-d5Ch5JM). I highly recommend you watch the video.

But to give you a quick summary, a **[quine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)>)** is a program that outputs its own source code as its only output.

## The Goal

The question is: How can a program output its own source without being told what that source is?

You need to write a program that contains two things:

1. String representation of itself
2. Code that prints a string representation of itself

You can find a bunch of quine programs [here](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/quineprograms/), but I’ll be covering Python below.

## Simple Quine in Python

```python
s = 's = %r\nprint(s %% s)'
print(s % s)
```

The output? The exact same thing!

```python
s = 's = %r\nprint(s %% s)'
print(s % s)
```

You should try it! Open up `ipython` and paste in the exact code. (side note, this gives a good idea for my website—users should be able to run code snippets)

## How it’s Made

1. The string `s` contains a template with `%r` (repr format)
2. `print(s % s)` substitutes `s` into its own template
3. You get the program’s source code

If you want to learn more, I suggest reading the [Wikipedia article](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)#Multiquines>) on the different types of quines.
